# Grade Oven
## About
Grade Oven is a minimalist single-machine web server where instructors can make assignments to build/run/grade student code.  In practice, it's more flexible than that, but the main goal is allow students to submit programming assignments and get instant feedback with a focus on security (protecting the server from potentially malicious students).

## Setup (run it!)
This has only been tested on Ubuntu.  Adding support for other distributions of Linux should be trivial.  Adding support to any operating system that can run Docker should be possible, but may be difficult.

#### Ubuntu
1. Prerequisites
    1. Ensure you have root (in order to run sudo apt-get and create users)
    1. Create a random key (just a bunch of random bytes) at data/secret_key.txt
    1. Create an SSL key and certificate at data/ssl/server.key and data/ssl/server.crt
1. Install packages and setup Docker environment
    1. Change into the `setup` directory in a shell
    1. Run `$ ./setup.sh`
1. Update admin password
    1. Change into the `src` directory
    1. Run `$ make run_debug_basic`
    1. Go to https://localhost:4321/login
    1. Login as "admin" with password "admin"
    1. Turn off the server (Ctrl+C the make command)
1. Run `$ make run_prod` in the "src" directory
